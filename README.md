# OPTIONS

- **--series**=#,  **-s**#
- **--compat**

    Choose different series of answer.  Default 1.  Series zero is same as
    the original game and option **--compat** is a short cut for
    **--series=0**.  If it is not zero, original answer word set is
    shuffled by pseudo random numbers using series number as an initial
    seed.

- **--index**=#, **-n**#

    Specify index. Default index is calculated from days from 2021/06/19.
    If the value is negative and you can get yesterday's question by
    giving -1.

    Answer for option **-s0n0** is `cigar`.

- **--**\[**no-**\]**result**

    Show result when succeeded.  Default true.

- **--random**

    Generate random index every time.

- **--try**=#, **-x**=#

    Set try count.  Default 6.

# COMMANDS

Five letter word is processed as an answer.  Some other input is taken
as a command.

- **h**, **hint**

    List possible words.

- **u**, **uniq**

    List possible words made of unique characters.

- **=**_chars_

    If start with slash, list words which include all of _chars_.

- **!**_chars_

    If start with exclamation mark, list words which does not include any
    of _chars_.

- _regex_

    regular expression to filter words.

`rents`, and made of unique characters.
